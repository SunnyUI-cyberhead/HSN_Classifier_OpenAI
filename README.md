# HSN_Classifier_OpenAI
Dual‐input HSN code classifier using TensorFlow and OpenAI function‐calling

# HSN Classifier

This repository holds a Jupyter notebook (`HSN_Classifier_OpenAI_Function_Calling.ipynb`) that:

1. Loads `HSN_SAC.xlsx` (place your Excel file in the same folder).
2. Trains a dual‐input Keras model on HSN codes + descriptions.
3. Demonstrates an OpenAI function‐calling wrapper around the trained model.

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Install dependencies:
3. Make sure `HSN_SAC.xlsx` sits next to the notebook, then open the notebook in Jupyter:
4. Run all cells (first cell installs needed packages; make sure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is in the environment).

## Environment

- Python 3.8+  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, openai, openpyxl
